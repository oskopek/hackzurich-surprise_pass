## Inspiration
What motivated us to pick this project was the idea of encouraging people to discover Switzerland in an environmentally friendly way.

## What it does
Surprise Pass offers customers a unique experience by planning an entire surprise day-trip for them. We cover everything there is to plan, so you don't have to worry about a thing! Of course, our trips are highly personalized with your preferences, which we collect either from your travel history or from a custom questionnaire.

## How we built it
One of us took care of the responsive user interface, design and server, while the other member of team got the data we needed for the project, collected information about the train routes, destinations, and other trip details and came up with an intelligent algorithm to decide which option would be the best fit for a customer.

## Challenges we ran into
The challenges came from both creating the web pages and especially from getting all the data we needed for creating the routes and deciding what would be the best approach to pick the day trip for a customer, while being limited with the pricing API.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We managed in just two people and a little over 20 hours to create an incredibly looking web application that is easy to use and works!

## What we learned
We definitely improved our front-end skills and learned new technologies, but most importantly we had the opportunity to think outside the box and come up with innovative solution to a real-world problem. 

## What's next for Surprise Pass
The beauty of our application is that it can be extended and improved indefinitely, adding more destinations, possibly expanding outside of Switzerland and providing our customers with even more surprises.
